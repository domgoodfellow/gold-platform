# Studio surfaces

Workspace and feature surface specifications. System-wide rules, including **Core rules**, are in [docs/ui-system.md](../ui-system.md). Before changing a surface here, check `docs/decisions/` for ADRs that name it.

## Website previews and editors

Website template previews use `components/display/preview-frame.tsx` to render the canonical website sections in an isolated, scaled viewport. Public responsive breakpoints must follow the preview width rather than the application's width. Studio website and form editors share `features/studio/editor-layout.tsx`; secondary panes respond to the available editor container width and open as page drawers on compact layouts. Editing state remains in the workbench owner when a drawer closes.

## Studio Home

Studio Home retains a contained website overview, four factual summaries, Forms/content, recent submissions, creation shortcuts and a supporting publishing/attention/public-surface/activity column even when empty. Public website links require both a ready managed hostname and a published revision. A published site can simultaneously have an unpublished working revision. Booking readiness consumes usable module access, published bookable types and a public slug; portal invitations remain in CRM and brand/public-address configuration remains in Organization Settings.
