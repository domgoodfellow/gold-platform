# Changelog

Shipped work, recorded on merge. Milestone definitions live in `docs/roadmap.md`; task state
lives on the issue board. Nothing here has a checkbox (`constraints.md` D9).

## Unreleased

### Generated database types, and the scaffolding decisions written down

M0's acceptance criterion is met. `/scope` was run against the tenancy kernel task and
returned five invariants and five decision records with nothing supplied by the operator.
Its one finding is now D18.

- `pnpm db:types` generates `apps/web/src/lib/db/database.types.ts` from the local schema,
  and the file is checked in. `Db` is `SupabaseClient<Database>` rather than an untyped
  client, which deleted a dozen casts of the form `row.id as string` and
  `row.email as string | null` — each one a column type hand-copied out of a migration, and
  each one silencing exactly the error the generic now catches. `organizations.ts`'s
  hand-written `MembershipRow` survives, but it is now *checked against* the generated embed
  shape rather than asserted over it.
- Generated types are not authoritative for function arguments. Postgres records no
  nullability for parameters, so `p_email text` — which accepts null by design — is emitted
  as `string`. Two casts in `customers.ts` bridge that and say why; they are the whole of
  that gap in this codebase.
- `schema-conformance.test.ts` compares the checked-in file against `pg_attribute` in both
  directions, because a stale generated file is worse than none: `tsc` will validate every
  query against a schema that no longer exists and pass. Verified by negative control both
  ways — an invented column fails as `customers.bogus_column`, a removed one as
  `customers.phone`.
- **D13-D17** record what the tree already did and no document had captured: pnpm without a
  build orchestrator, the App Router with one caller-JWT client per request, raw SQL
  migrations with generated types, vitest against a real Postgres and the four-step gate, and
  how tenant identity reaches Postgres. Each names its rejected alternative and what would
  trigger a revisit, and cites `tire-app-template` or `saas-agent-platform` where the two
  prior repos disagree.
- **D18** resolves the contradiction `/scope` found. D7 puts custom fields in the kernel; the
  no-column-without-a-caller rule forbids a `custom` column whose registry does not exist.
  The kernel is M1 and M1 is several slices, so both hold — and `roadmap.md` M1's acceptance
  criteria now name `field_definitions`, which is what gives D7 something that checks it.
- `CLAUDE.md`'s "Current state" described one vertical slice; four have shipped. Fixed, along
  with a stale invariant count in `roadmap.md` M0.

**No new invariant.** This change enforces nothing in `domain-model.md` that was not already
enforced — it removes a class of runtime error that has no row in that table. The `Enforced
by` column is unchanged on purpose.

Verified: 40 tests, gate green.

### Roles and capabilities

Turns I12 from "is there an actor" into "may this actor", and puts the answer in RLS.

- `infra/supabase/migrations/20260826000002_roles.sql` — `roles` per tenant, holding a name
  the tenant chooses and a `capabilities` array the platform defines. `memberships.role`
  (text nobody read) becomes `memberships.role_id`, backfilled from existing rows.
- A composite foreign key `(organization_id, role_id) → roles (organization_id, id)` makes
  "a membership's role belongs to the same organization" a database guarantee rather than
  something every caller must remember to check.
- `app.has_capability(organization_id, capability)` is the single answer to "may the caller
  do this here", and it is called from `customers_insert`, `roles_insert` and
  `memberships_update`. Creating a customer now requires `customer.create`, not mere
  membership.
- `public.assign_role` refuses to leave an organization with nobody holding `role.manage`.
  That is an invariant spanning rows, so it cannot be a column constraint and must not be a
  domain-only check a direct RPC call would walk past.
- `lib/domain/tenancy/capabilities.ts` declares the capability vocabulary; `roles.ts` owns
  what a well-formed role is. `/organizations/[organizationId]/roles` lists roles and, for
  those who may, creates them.
- **New invariant I16** — every declared capability is backed by a database policy.
  `schema-conformance.test.ts` reads `pg_policy` and fails if one is not. Verified by
  negative control: adding an unenforced capability makes it fail by name.

Verified against a database rebuilt from scratch with `pnpm db:reset`: 39 tests, gate green.

### Customer

The first genuinely tenant-owned entity — `organizations` is the tenant, and `memberships`
and `events` merely reference it.

- `infra/supabase/migrations/20260826000001_customers.sql` — `customers` with
  `organization_id`, RLS enabled and forced, and `customers_org_email_unique` on
  `(organization_id, lower(email))`. That index is the regression test for the failure
  `constraints.md` names: a global `customers_email_unique` meant two tenants could never
  share a customer email address.
- `public.create_customer` is SECURITY **INVOKER**, unlike `create_organization`. The caller
  is already a member, so RLS covers both inserts and the function needs no privilege of its
  own — it is purely a transaction boundary, so a customer can never exist without the
  timeline event that opens its history.
- `lib/domain/customers/customers.ts`, and `/organizations/[organizationId]/customers`. The
  organization is a route parameter rather than session state, so nothing needed an "active
  organization" concept that has no other caller yet.
- `tests/customers.test.ts` — eight tests, including two tenants holding the same customer
  email address, and a rollback check proving a failed creation leaves no orphan event.

`schema-conformance.test.ts` covered the new table with no change, which is what it was for.

### Next 16 `middleware` → `proxy`

`src/middleware.ts` became `src/proxy.ts` and `lib/db/middleware.ts` became
`lib/db/session.ts`, which is what it always did. The build no longer warns.

### Authentication and session

Makes the platform reachable by a person rather than only by its tests.

- `apps/web/src/proxy.ts` and `lib/db/session.ts` — session refresh on every
  request, plus a redirect for anonymous callers. The redirect is convenience: the
  server-side guard and RLS remain the authorization boundary, and the redirect target is a
  fixed literal because a `?next=` parameter would be an open redirector.
- `lib/domain/identity/credentials.ts` — sign in, register, sign out, with email
  normalisation and a password minimum owned by the domain rather than by provider config.
  Sign-in failure returns one message whether the account is absent or the password is
  wrong, so it cannot be used to enumerate addresses.
- `/sign-in`, `/sign-up`, and sign-out on the organizations page. All callers.
- `tests/schema-conformance.test.ts` — reads `pg_class`, `pg_index`, and `pg_constraint` to
  assert RLS and the leading-column rule for **every** table in `public`, including tables
  not written yet. Carries its own negative control.
- `tests/identity.test.ts` — registration, sign-in, normalisation, and the
  non-enumeration property.

**I1** and **I2** are now enforced for every future table, not only the three that exist.
**I12** gains the server-side guard that runs regardless of the proxy.

Verified: 20 tests, and the redirect behaviour checked against a running dev server. The
browser cookie handshake through `@supabase/ssr` is covered only in parts — a
browser-level test is the honest way to close that, and does not exist yet.

### Tenancy kernel — organizations, memberships, events

The first vertical slice: schema, domain, route, UI, guard, test.

- `infra/supabase/migrations/20260825000001_tenancy.sql` — `organizations` (the tenant),
  `memberships`, and the append-only `events` table; RLS enabled and forced on all three;
  `app.current_tenant_ids()` as the single tenant resolution point; `public.create_organization`
  as the narrow privileged bootstrap.
- `apps/web/src/lib/domain/tenancy/` — `listMyOrganizations`, `createOrganization`,
  `requireActor`. The route, the server action, and the form are callers and decide nothing.
- `apps/web/tests/tenancy.test.ts` — two organizations with identical names in one database,
  under two genuinely signed-in users. Verified non-vacuous: three organizations exist while
  one user sees two and the other sees one.

Newly enforced: **I1, I2, I3, I11, I12** (see `docs/domain-model.md`).

Deliberately absent: no `packages/`, no `services/api/`, no roles table, no per-tenant
terminology, no Customer, Location, Asset, Work Item, Resource, Document, or Field
Definition. Each arrives with the slice that needs it.
